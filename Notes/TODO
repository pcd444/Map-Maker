Short term
- Build & test basic forward method. Because it is so simple to do differnt projections test multiple.

- If there are issues then try to make a backwards method.
 - Start with building a newton solver for known derivatives, test multiple formulas.
 - If that works use it into a backwards method that uses random guessing. Test multiple projections.
 - If there are issues build the forwards to backwards method.



Longer term
- do meat

If time:
- Change x,y,px,thet,phi submit button onclick to correct x y and px if they don't 100% agree.
  This is so that one pixel is the right amount of movement.

- Check if batch updating canvas w/ image data is better than by pixel using rect.
